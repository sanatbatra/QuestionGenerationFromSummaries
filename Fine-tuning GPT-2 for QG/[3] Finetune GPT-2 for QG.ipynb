Joe, being a \"barefoot\" child, had to learn the various fighting styles of the various fighting styles of the Japanese. He then met Captain Crazy Pete (Wendell Corey) at a circus. Captain Crazy Pete was a circus elephant who had sunk into the ring while Joe was on his way to the ring. Joe got his kick kick-ass ass ass in the ring by beating Captain Crazy Pete, and then escaping, and climbing up on him and escaping to the top of the Mount Everest.\n","Once up there, Joe witnesses first hand the bravery and fortitude with which the natives had faced the will of the Europeans, and then the arrival of the English explorer, Captain Crazy Pete. Joe is captivated by Captain Crazy Pete, and after he rescues the wounded Spaniard, he is set upon by the fierce natives, until finally Captain Crazy Pete is driven off, and Joe escapes in a boat.\n","The next morning, Joe begins his adventure by riding off from Everest. He campfires at a waterfall, and when scrubby Indians show up at the boat shelter, Joe boldly says \"Hello\", in both English and Spanish. He then braves an attack of the \"perfect\" natives, and finally claims the Indian camp, which he has just vacated. He encounters \"one of them Barry Bonds\" and, after a short struggle, escapes, and makes for England.\n","The next day, Joe finds that his blanket has been stolen, and that his bicycle is missing. He phoned his friend Roger, of which he had a file with a lock number, and said \"Hello Barry\", to which Roger said \"You're awfully good\". Joe reconnects with his mother, and she says \"You're awfully good\", and they make love over a period of several days. Joe begins to miss her, saying \"You're a great help, you know that?\". Roger quits his job and goes to live with his sister, who has been living with Joe and his mother in Africa.\n","[answer] The Indian.

Joe claims to be from Kansas, but is actually from North Dakota.\n","After learning a woman named Kayla slept with Baskin a few years ago, Joe (ironically) left his state with Kayla, and is now homeless. He claims to have a car that is both his and Kayla's, and to have driven Kayla and her then-boyfriend/partner to and fro thousands of miles throughout the years, and to have driven those around Kayla's car almost nothing in the way of possessions. Kayla's kidnapping is the focus of the story; Joe claims to have lent his car to Kayla when she was a child, and as she was driving the car on her way to Kansas, it failed to go over the speed limit, killing two teenagers in the process, and causing Joe to lose control of the car, which slammed into a brick building.\n","Joe returns to Joe's old house, and to his surprise is greeted by Kayla. Kayla explains that, having split up with his ex-girlfriend, he can no longer have her, and thus must return to his old life. Joe relays this to Kayla, and she drives away. Then Joe finds a woman named Catherine Rampling, who is a warehousing tenant. Joe relays this information to Catherine, as well, and she ultimately relays it to Kayla. Kayla and Joe then drive south together until they see a homeless man named Albrecht Cole where Kayla has previously placed a ad in the paper. Albrecht claims to have a car that can go from point A to B in a matter of seconds, and Joe realizes that he knows the Rampling family well, having been closely followed by Kayla's sister, Shannon. A newly discovered photograph shows Shannon tied up and in Joe's car, and Joe realizes that his knowledge of the Rampling family is actually knowledge of Ben, who was in fact Kayla's twin. Joe relays this information to Kayla, and she relays it to Shannon.\n","Shannon and Joe then stop at an African Cultural Fair, and Shannon grows suspicious after Joe points out to her that all the cars at the fair have black and white stripes, as well as the fact that every single car has a \"No Wound\" sticker affixed to it.

Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is \"Everybody Knows\" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show. Nobody knows the true identity of \"Hard Harry\" or \"Happy Harry Hard-on,\" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicideÃ¢Â€Â”at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release. Eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling \"problem students,\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding. Realizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \"talk hard.\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8Bao9jIdulwX","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"1ab2578a-89f1-4351-ee50-ce360e56acee","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587322407404,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":103584,"user":{"displayName":"Tin B Luu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GintuEIe21zfimzTFUecMGkDlXSvHczNgFpjj6rMQ=s64","userId":"16311439415299252981"}}},"source":["ans = input(\"Answer: \")\n","qst = \"[question]\"\n","pre = '<|startoftext|>\\n[summary] ' + ctx + \"\\n[answer]\" + ans + \"\\n\" + qst"],"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Answer: Mark is a high school student in Phoenix.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JtetUvAFujXZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"M-stpVxhuSyw","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":529},"outputId":"7020375a-c147-46c5-bc17-78dd9485e3cd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587322847516,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":27356,"user":{"displayName":"Tin B Luu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GintuEIe21zfimzTFUecMGkDlXSvHczNgFpjj6rMQ=s64","userId":"16311439415299252981"}}},"source":["gpt2.generate(sess,\n","              run_name = run_name,\n","              length=50,\n","              temperature=0.1,\n","              top_k = 40, \n","              top_p = 0.9,\n","              prefix= pre,\n","              nsamples=10,\n","              batch_size=1,\n","              include_prefix = False,\n","              truncate = \"<|endoftext|>\"\n","              )"],"execution_count":50,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":[" What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"," What is Mark Hunter's hometown?\n","\n","====================\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"zjjEN2Tafhl2"},"source":["For bulk generation, you can generate a large amount of text to a file and sort out the samples locally on your computer.
